# Target

`glsl-simulator` is a pure JavaScript compiler and runtime for GLSL shaders. It is designed to
provide (browser) developer tools with the runtime information necessary to implement traditional
debugging features such as stepping through control flow, introspecting live state and logging.
As such, it is currently designed to run in a full browser environment.

# Dependencies

`glsl-simulator` uses a PEG.js grammar to parse the OpenGL ES 1.0 Shader Language (GLSL).
Usually the generated grammar is also checked into the repository. To change the grammar
and regenerate the JavaScript parser, you need to install NPM module `pegjs`, and then run:

    $ bin/generate-parser.sh

# Running

Currently, the project is exercised through several demo pages. See the `demo/` directory.
